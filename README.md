# Affinity Analysis for Market Basket Analysis

## üìã Overview

This repository contains an R-based implementation of affinity analysis (market basket analysis) on online retail data. The project demonstrates how to use association rules and collaborative filtering techniques to identify product relationships and generate recommendations based on purchase patterns.

## üìä Dataset

The analysis uses the **Online Retail Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains transaction data from a UK-based online retailer. The dataset includes:

- Invoice numbers
- Product descriptions
- Quantities
- Transaction timestamps
- Customer IDs
- Country information

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Dependencies

The analysis requires the following R packages:
- `data.table`
- `readxl`
- `tidyverse`
- `lubridate`
- `skimr`
- `knitr`
- `treemap`
- `httr`
- `recommenderlab`

### Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**: Automatically downloads the dataset from UCI repository
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removal of cancelled orders
   - Filtering non-positive quantities
   - Exclusion of non-product items
   - Handling missing values
   - Date/time extraction

3. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Top selling products visualization
   - Transaction patterns by time of day and day of week
   - Purchase size distribution
   - Geographic distribution of sales

4. **Model Development**:
   - Binary rating matrix creation
   - Multiple recommendation algorithms:
     - Association Rules (AR)
     - Random Items
     - Popular Items
     - Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)
     - User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Cross-validation scheme
   - ROC curve analysis
   - Precision-Recall evaluation

6. **Prediction**:
   - Example of generating recommendations for new users
   - Top-N product recommendations

## üìà Key Insights

The analysis provides:
- Identification of frequently purchased together items
- Evaluation of different recommendation algorithms
- Visualization of purchase patterns and trends
- Framework for generating real-time product recommendations

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required R packages
3. Run the `affinity_analysis.R` script
4. Review generated visualizations and model evaluations
